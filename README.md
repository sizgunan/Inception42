# Inception42

## Project Description

This project utilizes Docker to create a robust web infrastructure featuring MariaDB, Nginx, WordPress, Redis for caching, cAdvisor for monitoring, and Adminer for database management. Each service runs in its own Docker container, ensuring isolation and ease of management. The setup is designed to enhance your understanding of system administration and containerization.
